# MarioRemake
A remake of the classic Mario game for NES.

<p>This was a class project for CSE 3902 at OSU. This project was complete by a 3 person team over the length of a semester.
My team was tasked with recreating the first level of Mario using C# and maintain high quality code and OOP.</p>

<p>For the last sprint of this project the team was given the liberty of add our own levels and features that were not present
in the original game.</p>

New features:
- <b>Ice flower power-up</b>: Freezes enemies for a short time
