This was a class project for CSE 3902 at OSU. This project was complete by a 3 person team over the length of a semester.
My team was tasked with recreating the first level of Mario using C# and maintain high quality code and OOP.

For the last sprint of this project the team was given the liberty of add our own levels and features that were not present
in the original game.


### **New features:**
