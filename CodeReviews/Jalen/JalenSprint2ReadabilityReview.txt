Naming: 
	- The currentFrame variable makes sense, but cyclelength could use a bit more of an explanation behind it. 
	When cyclelength is utilized within the Draw method, it's not completely clear as to what it is used for, 
	so the naming could be improved (spriteFrameLength possibly). The variables source and destination could 
	be improved to be more specific, possible spriteSource and destinationOnPage.
	- The other method names are specific enough, as not much more than Draw and Update are needed within a sprite
	class. The methods are self-explanatory in their uses.

Explanation of what is taking place within the class:
	- The draw method has no explanation of what is taking place. After looking at the method (due to my familiarity with
	this project), I can tell what is taking place within the class, but overall it appears confusing at first glance. Maybe
	include an explanation as to what is happening within the method in a comment beforehand.
	- The update method does not have any comments, though it does not need any. It is just moving through the cycle and reseting the
	current frame at the end, and anyone familiar with basic programming can understand that.

Additional Notes:
	- The numbers within the rectangles seem rather random, so an explanation as to where they come from may be helpful to an outside
	reader. Possibly speak to what sprite page the sources are being drawn from, so a user can reference that page themselves
	- Possibly explain why the cyclelength is set to 60 and the reasoning behind the division/multiplication within the draw method.
