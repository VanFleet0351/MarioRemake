Naming: Good
	- The destination variable could be more clear to signify that it is the location on the screen. However, this variable name
	is used throughout the entire project, so changing it for one class would not be smart
	- The use of a getter and setter for position is smart, as it will allow the variable to be redefined later on.
	- sizeX and sizeY are also smart variable names, as they cleary define that they determine the width and height of the 
	sprite. However, the names "spriteWidth" and "spriteHeight" may have been more clear
	- The RetrieveSpriteRectangle() name is also clear as to what its purpose is, so the naming there should not be changed

Explanation of what is taking place within the class: Not Very Clear
	- None of the methods have an explanation as to what is happening within the class. There's no telling why the Update class
	is empty, nor is there a reason for why we need to retrieve the sprite rectangle. 
	- However, it's important to note that the class is fairly simple on the surface, so not much of an explanation should
	be provided. A bunch of comments would just crowd the class.

Additional Notes:
	- The numbers for the rectangles may appear random to someone at first. Possibly explain that the source correlates to 
	the texture atlas.
