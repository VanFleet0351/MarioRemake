Comments on Quality: 

Coupling: Low
-This class is dependent on only FireballSprite, FireballPhysicsObject, ParticleEngine, and SoundFactory, all of which are necessary for the class
-There do not appear to be any unncessary dependencies
-Having only three dependencies (one for sprites, one for particles, and one for physics) makes sense in the context of this class,
so nothing should be changed here.

Cohesion: High
-The purpose of this class is very clear and straightforward
-The class does not try to do to much and has a one purpose and one purpose only
-There is one unnecessary method, but nothing else not needed within this class, so not much else can be said on the topic of cohesion

Suggestions for improvement: 
-Because there is no side collision for fireballs (they just destroy when colliding with an object), that method does not need to exist within the
class. Other than that, the class is concise and written well. Nothing else needs to be changed within the class.
