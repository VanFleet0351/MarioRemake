Coupling: Low
This class only makes use of its designed "explosion" and "physicsobject" classes, as well as a particle system. 
All of these are necessary for the purpose of this class. 

Cohesion: High
Each method in the class has a clear purpose and does not try to do too much. The entire goal of the class is clear 
(as it just functions as the base object class for iceballs), and removing methods or putting them into
separate classes would not help cohesion and would overcomplicate things.

Additional Notes: 
This class does a good job following the same conventions that have been used throughout the project for similar objects.
It's clear, concise, and does not have any unnecessary comments or information within it. Additionally, the naming 
of the variables and classes are all good as well.

Hypothetical Changes:
If other powerups with similar physics were to be added (such as an acid  ball or something of the sort), we'd have to 
write 3 new classes all over again in the exact same manner. Because iceball and fireball have nearly identical properties, 
they likely could have just used a common interface (which would make adding another one easier in the future as well).
