Comments on Quality:

Coupling: medium/low
- This class has quite a few dependencies that are used within it, though all of them appear to be necessary
- The class references many classes of the game (camera, enemy spawner, mario, collision). It's likely that this State could be
separated into multiple classes to lower coupling
- Many parts of mario are modified within this class (state, physics object, position), which is not ideal
- Each dependency has a clear purpose within the class, however the use of this many dependencies clutters the class and raises coupling


Cohesion: medium/high
- There are many methods here, but they are all inherited from the Abstract Game State class, so this is consistent throughout
all game states
- The purpose of this class is relatively clear (end the game). However, so much else is handled within the update method, making its
actual functionality somewhat less clear.

Additional Notes
- The variable used to determine if the level has been completed is "soundPlayed", which could very likely be changed to more accurately reflect
what its purpose is

Hypothetical changes:
- Suppose the level needed to be made longer or shorter for some reason. You'd have to go in and manually edit the coordinates for the end
of the level. To fix this, magic numbers could be removed and turned into a variable within the level itself.
