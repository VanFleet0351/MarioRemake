Comments on Quality: 

Coupling: Low
This class has 2 dependencies, and that is Icommand and the game. Both of these are necessary. The ICommand interface
is extended by the class, as it is a command itself. This allows for more organization amongst commands. The game is
necessary, as it cocntains the mario class that is being moved. No other depencies exist within the class, resulting
in a low dependency.

Cohesion: High
This class has one specialized purpose, and that is exactly what the name says it does. It moves mario to the mouse
via a click. It handles its purpose well and does not try to do anything outside of this scope, so the cohesion is
high.

Suggestions for improvement: 
Possibly rename the variables to something more specific instead of x and y (possible marioXPosition etc). Additionally,
there are many random numbers within the class with no explanation as to why they are chosen (there's a 20 and a 50 with 
no reasoning behind them). Possibly add an explanation behind the loops or assign the numbers to variables to explain them
and make it more understandable.
