Comments on Quality: The code does not appear to generate any errors. The variables are defined well before any methods, and 
					the code follows all guidelines for a standard state. It is well laid out and consistent with the rest of 
					the state classes within the project.

Suggestions for improvement:	Define the variables before the constructor, but assign the values within the constructor itself.
