Naming: Good
-The names of the variables all make sense and are relevant to their uses
-The names of the methods are all inherited, but are good nonetheless. Each one has a clear purpose.

Explanation of what is happening: Okay
-Uses a few arbitrary number values here and there with no explanation on their purpose
-Easy to follow the train of thought within the methods. Clear flow of logic within the Update method.
-Many of the uses of the variables are self-explanatory thanks to their names. Variables like "soundPlayed" and "RightCommand" have 
clear functionality that needs no explanation
-Code is concise and not full of extra lines -- easy to follow

Additional Notes:
-Cohesion is very high but coupling is not as low as it should idealy be
-Functionality of the class is clear. Used to end game and does so well
-Relies on many other classes in its implementation. Hard to tell if this is necessary.
