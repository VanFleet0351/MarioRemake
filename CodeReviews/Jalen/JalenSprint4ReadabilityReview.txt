File under review: MarioPhysicsObject.cs

Time spent on review: 15 minutes

Naming: Good
	- Though there are many variables, most have enough clarity within the name to give an understanding of their purpose
	The only variables that may cause some confusion are dx, dy, and dt, though a simple understanding of calculus would
	allow the user to understand these variables.
	- The names of the methods are all good. They clearly explain the purpose of the method within Mario's physics without
	being too wordy.
	- The variable jumpTick could also cause some confusion. Possibly change it to jumpTimer or jumpFrame to provide more
	clarity. 

Explanation of what is taking place within the class: Not Very Clear
	- There are a great deal of variables declared immediately, and many of which are given arbitrary values. While it's clear
	that these were decided through trial and error, adding an explanation as to the purpose of some of them would be helpful
	for someone else looking into the class trying to decipher what is happening. 
	- There are some notes made throughout the class that explain (e.g. the comments relating to accelaration and momentum), but 
	there are definitely not enough notes for someone reading the class to easily understand it all quickly. An outsider
	would likely need an explanation for some of the methods within the class.
	- Overall, while it's clear that this class functions well (as seen through playing the game), the readibility of this class
	leaves a lot of confusion.

Additional Notes:
	- This class will definitely require some refactoring before the next sprint begins. The amount of effort put in to the class
	is clearly very high, and it's clear that it took a great deal of time to figure out. The only changes that will be made will
	be for readability's sake only, as the code quality is very high.
