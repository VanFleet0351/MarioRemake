Comments on quality: This file created a runtime error that occurs wehn unknow keys are pressed. 
					 The class also does not yet change states properly. These create a disppearing left facing mario and crashes. 

Suggestion w/ implementation notes: My suggestion is to add a check for if a key had been pressed as mentioned in class. 
Other issues are already being resolved and updated by Kyle
