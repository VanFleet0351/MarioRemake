Comments on Quality:

Coupling: low, loose could be lower and looser though
-Most of the Objects used in this class are necessary for the functionality
of this class.
- If the levelManager was used to load in all the objects on the screen we could
reduce coupling with all of the different sprite objects used in draw.


Cohesion: High
- Cohesion is pretty high, all the class does is load in objects for the screen
and display them.
- It also calls a method to play a song and it updates the keyboard. These 2 thing 
don't do much to take away from the cohesion and if they were removed it might 
reduce cohesion and increase coupling else where.

Hypothetical changes:
- by using the levelManger and loading in a XML with all the objects and there locations
would remove all but 5 lines of the code in the draw method.
- That being said I feel that it might've taken just as long if not longer to 
create the xml file if not already familar with XML
