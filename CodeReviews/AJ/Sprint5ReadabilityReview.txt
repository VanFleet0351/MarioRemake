File under review: FloatingStat.cs
Author of file: Kyle Van-Fleet
Time: 7 minutes

Naming: Good
-The name of the file is concise and says everything about what it is. 
-It's the floating stat that is displayed when you gain points

Explanation of what is happening:
-very self explanatory code, well-written
-string StatValue is what will be written, very easy to tell this with the Draw method
-Vector2 PositionOnScreen is where the StatValue will be written, also very easy to tell this with the Draw method
-lifetime lets the floating stat be around for 60 updates, or about one second, easy to tell what it does in the update method
-also in the update method, easy to see how the stat is moving every update
-everything is very concise, no extra or repeated code anywhere

Additional Notes:
-extremely high cohesion and low coupling
-all it does is create and draw one stat in the HUD
-only coupling is to XNA framework for the Vector2 class, which is fantastic
