Naming: Good naming, it is the game state for level 2 so it really can't b more concise than this

Explanation: It initializes by making the new LevelManager for the level,
attaching the level to all of the factories, starting the music, and resetting the camera. Due to
good naming, it is very easy to see what is happening throughout the initialization. Update calls
update on everything attached to the level, including the controller, level, and collisions. It 
also checks if the player is dead and updates that state accordingly. Draw just calls the level
Draw method which eventually calls all of the other Draw methods.

Additional Notes: I can't think of any improvements. It's concise, and easy to read through and
understand.
